        <h2 class="heading-medium">Description</h2>

        <p class="text">
          This exemption allows you to install a service crossing below the bed of a main river not using an
          open cut technique but using directional drilling, for example to install an electricity service duct.
        </p>

          </li>
          <li>
            the distance from the bed of the main river to the top of the service crossing is at least 1.5
            metres along its whole length, and the same height above sea level is maintained between
            points 5 metres beyond the top of each bank of the main river
          </li>
          <li>
            the distance from the launch and reception pits to the landward side of each bank of the main

          </li>
          <li>

          <li>
            the service crossing is 50 metres or more upstream of any impoundment or artificially raised
