<p>You don't need a permit if you plan to do one of these excluded activities. But you must operate within the conditions of the exclusion.</p>

<p>If you plan to do any other activities on or near a main river, <a href="/version_4/guidance/flood-risk-activities-environmental-permits">check which permits you might need to do work</a>.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Work in an emergency</h2>

<p>When there is a risk of serious flooding, or damage to drainage or the environment, you can take preventative measures without consent. But you must write to the Environment Agency as soon as possible afterwards, explaining what happened and what you did.</p>

<p>You’ll need a permit if you plan to use a temporary defence measure (like a freestanding barrier) whenever there is an emergency, unless it is already exempt or is attached to a building (like an airbrick cover).</p>

<p>Find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/flooding-what-to-do-before-during-and-after-a-flood">what to do in a flood</a>.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Licensable marine activity in England</h2>

<p>You must inform the Environment Agency if you have applied to the Marine Management Organisation for a marine licence. If the Environment Agency decides you don’t need an environmental permit, they will tell you in writing.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Using ladders and scaffold towers</h2>

<p>You can use these if they are taken down at the end of each day and stored away from the river. Each day, before you put them up, you must check that their use will not increase flood risk.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Services crossing a river within an existing structure</h2>

<p>This could be something like laying cables in a pavement over a bridge. The crossing must be within the profile of the existing structure. You must not work from the river or the bank and you must store any equipment you use away from the river.</p>

<p>If the existing structure has been identified for removal under a river basin management plan, you must apply for an environmental permit before you can do any work.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Flood protection devices attached to buildings</h2>

<p>You can work on door boards, airbrick covers and other attached devices without a permit.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Highways, rights of way, crossing bridges and culverts</h2>

<p>You don’t need a permit as long as your work doesn’t affect the riverbed, banks, water level or flow in the river (including flood flow).</p>

<p>You must not work on the river or from the bank and any equipment you use must be stored away from the river.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Post and rail or post and wire fencing in a floodplain</h2>

<p>You can put fencing on a floodplain but not on the bed or banks of a main river.</p>

<p>If you use wire, it must be either wire strands or at least 100mm spaced mesh.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Temporary use of small fish traps</h2>

<p>Fish traps must be no bigger than 2m x 1m x 0.75m. The fish trap or combination of traps together must take up less than a third of the river’s channel width. You must place them more than 50m upstream or downstream of any obstruction. You must not use them when the river is in high flow.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Noticeboards more than 2m from the top of a river bank</h2>

<p>You must attach the noticeboard to an existing fence or freestanding permanent post. It must be more than 2m from any culvert, remote defence or flood defence structure, or sea defence.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Clearing out a purpose-built sediment trap</h2>

<p>You must not release sand or silt downstream when cleaning out a trap. If you want to deposit the silt on the floodplain, you must spread it:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
<li>to a depth of no more than 100mm</li>
<li>no closer than 8m from the riverbank</li>
<li>You should check if you need a waste permit or exemption.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Site investigation boreholes and trial pits</h2>

<p>You may do this work if it’s:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
<li>within the floodplain of a main river</li>
<li>more than 5m from a culvert, remote defence or flood defence structure, or sea defence</li>
<li>more than 8m from the riverbank (16m if it’s a tidal river)</li>
</ul>

<p>You must complete the work and refill within 48 hours.</p>
