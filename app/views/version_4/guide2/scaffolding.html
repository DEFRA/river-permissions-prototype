      <h1 class="heading-xlarge">Scaffolding and ladders: check if you need a permit to do work</h1>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">First check if the scaffolding is on a main river</h2>

      <p>You will usually need permission to do work under or near a main river or flood defence that could affect flood risk, land drainage or access to the river. You don’t need permission to work on ‘ordinary watercourses’ such as small rivers, streams and ditches. But you may need land drainage consent.</p>

      </p>

<!-- ================================================ -->

<h2 class="heading-medium">Ladders and scaffold towers that are taken down at the end of each day</h2>

<p>You don't need permssion if they are taken down at the end of each day and stored away from the river. Each day, before you put them up, you must check that their use will not increase flood risk.</p>


<h2 class="heading-medium">Temporary scaffolding (up to 4 weeks) for up to 10m length</h2>

<p>If you can meet the <a href="/version_4/guidance/exemption_list#fra6">conditions</a> you can <a href="#">register an exemption</a> to erect temporary scaffolding for up to 4 weeks. If you can't meet the conditions you will need to <a href="#">apply for a permit</a>.</p>

<details class="in-guidance">
  <summary><span class="summary">Main conditions for this exemption</span></summary>

  <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">

    <p>The scaffolding:</p>

    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>must not be across whole structures such as bridges or weirs</li>
      <li>does not take up more than 10 metres of a river bank</li>
      <li>does not project more than 1.2m or 10% of the width of the river</li>
      <li>is at least 200m away from an environmentally sensitive area such as a Site of Special Scientific Interest</li>
      <li>is not in place between 15 March and 15 June</li>
      <li>on a salmonid river, is not in place between 1 October and 14 March</li>
      <li>any transoms and walking decks are set no lower than 600 mm above water level</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a summary only. You must check the <a href="/version_4/guidance/exemption_list#fra6">full list of conditions</a> before you register an exemption. If you register, we will check if the location is environmentally sensitive or if it is near a flood defence structure operated by us.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Temporary scaffolding up to 20m length</h2>

<p>If you can erect the scaffolding following our standard rules for temporary scaffolding up to 20m length you could apply for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sr2015-no34-temporary-scaffolding-affecting-up-to-20-metres-length-of-a-main-river">standard rules permit</a>.</p>

<p>These rules allow you to erect and use temporary scaffolding up to 20 metres length for a maximum of 4 weeks. The watercourse must be at least 4 metres in width. You cannot erect scaffolding within 8 metres of flood defences and outside the relevant fish breeding season.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">All other scaffolding</h2>

<p>You will need a <a href="#">bespoke permit</a>.</p>


<!-- ================================================ -->

<h2 class="heading-medium">Emergency work</h2>
<p>
  You don't need a permit for activities carried out in an emergency. But you must write to the Environment Agency as soon as you can afterwards, to tell them what work you have done and the circumstances of the emergency.
</p>
<p>
  An emergency is a situation that presents a risk of serious flooding, serious damage to land drainage or serious harm to the environment.
